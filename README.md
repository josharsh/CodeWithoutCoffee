## 'Coffee' is a metaphor to all 'non-sustainable' means of productivity hacks that modern sofware engineering culture often embraces.
Some of these are - 
* <b>Dependence on external stimuli for focus</b>: Relying on external stimulants, such as high doses of coffee or energy drinks, to enhance concentration and maintain focus during work.
* <b>Neglecting rest and rejuvenation</b>: Ignoring the importance of rest, breaks, and rejuvenation in favor of continuous work.
* <b>Sacrificing work-life balance for relentless work</b>: Prioritizing work at the expense of personal well-being, relationships, and leisure activities.
* <b>Perpetual busyness as a status symbol</b>: Embracing a culture that glorifies busyness and overcommitment, equating constant activity with productivity and success.
